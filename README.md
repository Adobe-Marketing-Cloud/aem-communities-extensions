aem-communities-extensions
==========================
The project includes samples and examples of extending AEM Communities components to build new social component or achieve desired functionality from existing components.

This project contains four sub-projects :
1. AEM Communities Idea Extension
2. AEM Communities Journal Extension
3. AEM Communities Subscription Management
4. AEM Communities Watchwords Extension

All the sub-projects can be built and used individually, or they can be built by building the aem-communities-extensions reactor project to build all of them in one go.
The installation can be done individually or via uber content package created at /content/target/. Configuration of each of the projects, as per directions in respective Readme,
need to be done individually.

IMPORTANT : Use branch master for AEM 6.4 and greater versions and branch 6.3 for AEM 6.3 and smaller versions.
